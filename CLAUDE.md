# Role
You are a Principal IoT Solutions Architect and Lead Full-Stack Developer specializing in Smart Agriculture (AgTech) infrastructure, multi-architecture Docker containerization for resource-constrained Edge hardware (NVIDIA Jetson Nano running Ubuntu 18.04), and modular React-Redux control dashboards.

# Context
I am building a foundational, centralized **Smart Farm Web Control Center** to ingest telemetry data from field sensors (soil moisture, temperature, etc.) and send remote commands down to actuators (valves, pumps, switches). 

The target deployment host is an older Jetson Nano (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). Because system memory and CPU are highly constrained on this machine—and must be preserved for potentially heavy edge automation or local AI models—I cannot run an independent React development server at runtime. 

Instead, the entire system must be containerized using Docker, with the React frontend compiled into static assets ahead of time and served directly via a unified Node.js/Express server on a single network port. This initial version must act as a clean, highly generic blueprint that allows me to plug in new device types and features later.

# Architectural & Container Requirements

### 1. Multi-Stage Docker & Compose Layout
* **Dockerfile:** Create an optimized multi-stage build targeting an ARM64/Jetson Nano friendly runtime base (like `node:16-alpine` or `node:18-slim` compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 glibc baselines).
  * *Stage 1 (Build):* Installs frontend tools and compiles the React application into a static production folder (`dist` or `build`).
  * *Stage 2 (Runtime):* Drops heavy build tools, copies over the static frontend assets and backend code, installs production-only Node dependencies, and exposes a single unified web port.
* **docker-compose.yml:** Include a basic compose file configured for low resource environments, managing auto-restarts and simple port exposure.

### 2. Extensible Node.js Core Backend
* **Data Ingestion API:** Create a lightweight POST endpoint (`/api/v1/telemetry`) to process generic JSON payloads (e.g., `device_id`, `timestamp`, `metrics: {}`) in-memory to prevent hammering the Jetson's SD card storage.
* **Device Command API:** Create a POST endpoint (`/api/v1/control`) to receive a target device ID and an action payload, ready for distribution to field nodes.
* **Unified Hosting:** Configure `express.static()` to natively host the pre-built React asset directory, gracefully mapping SPA routing fallbacks to `index.html`.

### 3. Modular React & Redux Toolkit UI
* **Generic Dashboard Grid:** Provide a clean, grid-based dashboard that dynamically displays a collection of "Device Cards."
* **Scalable Redux Structure:** Design a generic `devicesSlice` that stores field devices as objects in a flexible dictionary. The state must dynamically update whether an incoming metric is recorded or an actuator switch is flipped.
* Use lightweight polling mechanisms (like standard React intervals or RTK Query fixed intervals) to pull field changes safely without causing memory leaks or UI freeze on the browser side.

# Constraints & Design Principles
* **Hardware Agnostic Data Schemas:** Treat field units as generic definitions (e.g., "Device_01" with a dictionary of reading keys) so adding completely new sensor types later requires zero code changes.
* **Zero Runtime Overhead:** Absolutely no developer tools, live-reload watchers, or independent dev servers are permitted to run in the background at production runtime.

# Expected Output Format
Please provide:
1. **Infrastructure Files:** The complete production `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
2. **Project Directory Layout:** A clear folder tree showing how the frontend, backend, and Docker configs are mapped.
3. **The Server Code (`server.js`):** The clean Express application handling state routing, static delivery, and API endpoints.
4. **Frontend Architecture:** The Redux Toolkit state slice and a reusable React component that cleanly switches its rendering mode depending on whether a device is defined as a sensor or an actuator.

## Commands

- Backend: `npm install && npm start` (serves on `PORT`, default 3000).
- Frontend dev: `cd client && npm install && npm run dev` (Vite dev server, proxies `/api` to `localhost:3000`).
- Frontend production build: `cd client && npm run build` → outputs `client/dist`, which `server.js` serves via `express.static`.
- Full container: `docker compose up --build` from `web-server/`.

## Notes

- `GET /api/v1/devices` was added beyond the original two endpoints since the dashboard needs a way to fetch current state to poll.
- `GET /api/v1/health` returns `{ status, uptime, deviceCount, timestamp }` and backs the `docker-compose.yaml` healthcheck. The healthcheck probes it with `node -e` (via `http.get`) rather than `curl`/`wget`, keeping the `node:18-alpine` image dependency-free.
- **ESP32-CAM camera feed** (`src/routes/camera.js` + `src/store/frameStore.js`): the camera firmware's PUSH mode POSTs raw `image/jpeg` to `POST /api/v1/camera/frame`; the server keeps only the **latest** frame in a single-slot in-memory buffer (no SD writes) and exposes `GET /frame.jpg` (snapshot), `GET /stream` (multipart/x-mixed-replace MJPEG relay of the *pushed* frames — all viewers share the one buffer), and `GET /status`. Uses the built-in `express.raw()` — no new npm deps. Tunables: `CAMERA_MAX_FRAME_BYTES`, `CAMERA_STALE_MS`. On the camera side set `PUSH_ENABLED 1` and `PUSH_URL "http://<jetson-ip>:3000/api/v1/camera/frame"` in `include/secrets.h`.
- **Live video proxy** (`src/routes/camera.js` `GET /live` + `src/store/cameraLive.js`): the PUSH path above is ~1 frame/10s (a slideshow), and the camera's own high-fps `:81/stream` is only reachable from the camera's Wi-Fi subnet — so a browser viewing the deployed dashboard from elsewhere gets a black feed. `GET /api/v1/camera/live` fixes this: the server (on the camera's network) pulls the camera's `:81` MJPEG **once** and fans it out to all viewers **same-origin**, so any client that can load the dashboard sees live video and the camera serves a single connection (dodging its tiny concurrent-stream limit). Camera source via `CAMERA_STREAM_URL` env (default `http://192.168.0.3:81/stream`); auto-reconnects on transient drops, ends viewers on hard-down (page shows NO SIGNAL). The client's **relay** camera mode (now the default in `cameraSettings.js`) streams from `/api/v1/camera/live`; **custom** mode points the browser straight at a camera URL (needs direct reachability).
- **Server-owned dashboard settings** (`src/store/settingsStore.js` + `src/routes/settings.js`): the Settings-page **Camera Source** and **Pump Control** blocks used to live per-browser in `localStorage`; they are now **global, server-owned config** persisted to `data/settings.json` (atomic temp+rename write, on the same host volume as `camera-config.json`). `GET /api/v1/settings` returns the whole `{ cameraSource, pump }`; `POST` takes a **partial patch** (just the edited section), validates server-side (pump `url` must be http(s) since the server fetches it, `autoOffMinutes` 1–60, `sourceMode` = `relay|custom`), deep-merges, and returns the full object. Defaults are **env-seeded** (`PUMP_URL`, `PUMP_LABEL`, `PUMP_AUTO_OFF_MINUTES`, `CAMERA_SOURCE_MODE`/`_STREAM_URL`/`_SNAPSHOT_URL`, `SETTINGS_PATH`) and loaded at boot (`settingsStore.load()`). The client reads it via RTK Query (`settingsApi`, fetch-on-mount + `refetchOnFocus`/`refetchOnReconnect`, no polling; save invalidates the cache). `usePumpSettings()`/`useCameraSettings()` keep their names/shapes as thin wrappers over that query. **Camera device config (`camera-config.json`) is deliberately left separate** — it's a firmware-pulled contract, not dashboard settings.
- **Pump target is now server-owned:** the relay (`src/routes/pump.js`) reads the pump `url` **and** `autoOffMinutes` from `settingsStore`, so the client posts only `{ state }` to `/api/v1/pump/control` and `GET /api/v1/pump/status` takes no `target` arg. The old build-time `VITE_PUMP_URL` dev tunnel is retired — set `PUMP_URL` in the backend's `.env` (`npm run dev` loads it via Node's native `--env-file`); see `DEV.md`.
- Device state is in-memory only (a `Map` in `deviceStore.js`) — it resets on restart, by design, to avoid SD card wear on the Jetson.
- Not yet verified end-to-end (no `node`/`npm`/network access in the sandbox this was built in) — run the commands above on the target machine before trusting it.

# ESP32 Firmware Projects

The repo also contains firmware for the field devices that talk to the web-server:

- `esp-idf-iot/` — the reference **ESP-IDF** workspace (`web-server/` SoftAP+HTTP+OTA control server, `sensor-node/`, and `examples/`). GPL-3.0. The canonical smart-farm firmware; the projects below borrow its conventions.
- `esp32cam/` — **PlatformIO / Arduino** firmware for the AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM that pushes JPEG frames to the web-server's `/api/v1/camera/frame` (see the camera notes above). Uses a gitignored `include/secrets.h` (+ `secrets.example.h`) for WiFi/OTA creds.
- `ap-server/` — **PlatformIO / Arduino** firmware for an **ESP-WROOM-32** (`board = esp32dev`) that runs a Wi-Fi **SoftAP with a custom DHCP server** supporting **MAC→IP reservations** managed from a **web UI** and persisted in NVS. Grew out of the AP behavior of `esp-idf-iot/web-server` (ESP-IDF), re-implemented on Arduino to match `esp32cam`'s conventions.
- `sensor-zone/` — **PlatformIO / ESP-IDF** port of `esp-idf-iot/sensor-node` for an **ESP-WROOM-32** (`board = esp32dev`) mapped to a farm zone: reads DHT22 + soil-moisture ADC and POSTs telemetry to the Node web-server. A faithful `framework = espidf` port (not Arduino — the source is 100% IDF-native) using the **pioarduino** platform fork (IDF 5.3.x). Uses a gitignored `include/secrets.h` (+ `secrets.example.h`) to match `esp32cam`/`ap-server` conventions.
- `pump-zone/` — **PlatformIO / ESP-IDF** port of `esp-idf-iot/web-server` for an **ESP-WROOM-32** (`board = esp32dev`) — the **actuator counterpart to `sensor-zone`**: joins the AP as a STA and runs an `esp_http_server` that switches an **irrigation-pump relay** on command, showing status on an **RGB LED**. A deliberately *stripped + modernized* port keeping **only** relay control + LED status (drops the source's SoftAP provisioning, web UI, OTA, RTC/SNTP, sensor cache, and automatic irrigation). `framework = espidf` via the **pioarduino** fork (IDF 5.3.x); gitignored `include/secrets.h` (+ `secrets.example.h`).
- `pump-zone-esp01/` — **PlatformIO / Arduino** firmware for an **ESP-01/01S (ESP8266EX**, `board = esp01_1m`) — a **drop-in replacement for `pump-zone`** on cheaper ESP8266 hardware. Same role, same `DEVICE_ID` (`pump_zone_01`), same `/api/v1/relay` contract, so the hub/dashboard need zero changes. **Necessarily a rewrite, not a port:** ESP-IDF has no ESP8266 target, so it's rebuilt on the Arduino stack (`ESP8266WebServer` + ArduinoJson + `ESP8266WiFi` auto-reconnect). Adds a **local safety cutoff** (dead-man timer), a **device watchdog** (`src/watchdog.{cpp,h}` — SW/HW watchdog feed for acute loop hangs + a lost-link recovery layer that forces the pump OFF and reboots if WiFi stays down past `WIFI_RECOVER_MS`), and **ArduinoOTA**; collapses the RGB LED to single-LED blink codes. Note: this is the one **ESP8266** project despite the "ESP32 Firmware Projects" heading. Gitignored `include/secrets.h` (+ `secrets.example.h`).

- **AP-only** mode (no STA uplink), WPA2, standalone network (SSID `MJU-SmartFarm-AP-II`, password `password` — **change `AP_PASSWORD`**, `192.168.1.1`, ch 1, **max 10 clients**), deliberately distinct from the ESP-IDF reference AP (`MJU-SmartFarm-AP` @ `192.168.0.1`). All tunables in committed `include/ap_config.h`; no `secrets.h`.
- **Why a custom DHCP server:** the built-in ESP DHCP server (`dhcpserver.h`) exposes only a pool *range* (`dhcps_lease_t`) — **no MAC-based reservation API**, and its source is precompiled into the framework's lwIP lib so it can't be patched from PlatformIO. So `main.cpp` calls `esp_netif_dhcps_stop("WIFI_AP_DEF")` and `dhcp_server.cpp` runs our own on UDP/67, **polled from `loop()`** (single-threaded with `WebServer`, so the reservation table needs no locking).
- **Addressing:** `.1` = AP; **`.2`–`.99` reserved** (MAC→IP, the "server group"); **`.100`–`.109` dynamic** (`DHCP_POOL_FIRST_HOST` .. `+AP_MAX_CONNECTIONS-1`, guarded by `static_assert`). Reserved MAC → fixed IP; unknown MAC → dynamic lease (RAM table, reused per MAC, 2 h lease `DHCP_LEASE_SECS`).
- **Reservations** persist in NVS via `Preferences` (namespace `apres`, one blob of `{mac[6],octet,label[≤24]}`, cap `MAX_RESERVATIONS`=32); loaded in `reservations::begin()` at boot. Web UI: `/` dashboard (auto-refresh; connected clients w/ one-click **Reserve** prefilling MAC, + reservations table w/ **Delete**), `/edit` form (no refresh, so it isn't wiped mid-typing), `POST /api/reservations` (upsert, validates MAC + IP∈`.2`–`.99` + uniqueness), `POST /api/reservations/delete`. **No auth** — WPA2 is the gate. Changes apply on the device's **next DHCP renewal/reconnect**.
- Commands: `cd ap-server && pio run` / `pio run -t upload` / `pio device monitor` (115200). **Compiles clean on arduino-esp32 2.0.17 (esp32dev)** but the hand-rolled DHCP server is **not yet hardware-tested** — during first bring-up keep one client on a static `192.168.1.50` as a lifeline in case DHCP misbehaves.

- **Why `framework = espidf` (not Arduino):** the legacy source is 100% ESP-IDF-native (`esp_adc` oneshot+cali, `esp_http_client`, `esp_wifi`/`esp_netif`/`esp_event`, `nvs_flash`, IDF `driver/ledc`, `esp_efuse_mac`, `esp_rom_delay_us`). An Arduino port would be a rewrite of every module and would *break* signal parity, so the port keeps the C logic byte-for-byte and only changes the build wrapper + telemetry contract.
- **Why the pioarduino platform fork:** the code needs **IDF ≥ 5.2** (`ADC_ATTEN_DB_12` + `esp_adc/adc_oneshot`), which mainline `platformio/espressif32` doesn't ship. `platformio.ini` pins `https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32.git#53.03.13` (Arduino core 3.1.3 / **IDF 5.3.2**), matching the legacy IDF 5.3.1.
- **Layout:** the legacy `main/` is a *single* IDF component with subfolders, so it's flattened verbatim into `src/` with one adapted `src/CMakeLists.txt` (no `lib/` / `components/` split).
- **GPIO map (preserved exactly from the legacy build):** DHT22 data `GPIO32` (bit-banged); soil moisture `ADC1_CH6` = `GPIO34` @ `ADC_ATTEN_DB_12` (DRY 2800 mV → 0%, WET 1200 mV → 100%); RGB status LED via LEDC on `GPIO25/26/27` (active-high, 5 kHz, 8-bit, ch 0/1/2, timer 0); onboard status LED `GPIO2` (active-low, 500 ms blink). No I2C/SPI in use.
- **Telemetry contract changed on purpose:** the legacy firmware POSTed a *flat* body to the old ESP-IDF web-server (`192.168.0.1:80/sensor-update`). This port targets the **Node web-server** (`192.168.0.2:3000/api/v1/telemetry`), which **requires** a `metrics{}` object (else HTTP 400), so `http_client.c` nests the readings: `{"device_id":"…","metrics":{"temperature":…,"humidity":…,"soil_moisture":…}}` (timestamp omitted — no RTC; the server stamps it). Because the HTTP body deliberately differs from the legacy binary, **parity is verified on the physical-pin readings** (serial-log diff via `tools/parity_diff.py`), not on the wire payload.
- Commands: `cd sensor-zone && cp include/secrets.example.h include/secrets.h` (fill creds) → `pio run` / `pio run -t upload` / `pio device monitor` (115200) / `pio test -e native`. **Not yet compiled or hardware-verified** — the first `pio run` pulls the pioarduino platform + IDF 5.3.2 (slow, one-time); confirm `ADC_ATTEN_DB_12` resolves before trusting it.

```

- **Role in the topology:** unlike `sensor-zone` (an HTTP *client* that POSTs telemetry up), pump-zone is an HTTP *server*. It joins `MJU-SmartFarm-AP-II` as a STA (creds from `secrets.h`), takes a **DHCP** lease, and listens on `PUMP_HTTP_PORT` (80). Give it a stable address by **reserving its MAC** in `ap-server`'s web UI (the `.2`–`.99` "server group"). The Node hub or a browser POSTs pump commands **to** it.
- **Why `framework = espidf` + pioarduino:** the source `esp-idf-iot/web-server` is 100% IDF-native (`esp_http_server`, `esp_wifi`/`esp_netif`/`esp_event`, `driver/ledc`, `nvs_flash`, cJSON). Same platform pin as the siblings (`#53.03.13` = Arduino core 3.1.3 / IDF 5.3.2).
- **Deliberately stripped:** kept only `relay.c`, `rgb_led.c`, the HTTP server core + relay handler, and `main.c`. **Dropped** from the source: SoftAP + provisioning web UI + embedded assets, `app_nvs`, `irrigation_ctrl` (automatic irrigation), `sensor_cache`, `water_config`, `time_sync`/`rtc_ds3231`, OTA, and the monitor/status/wifi HTTP handlers. WiFi is `sensor-zone`'s STA-only `wifi_sta.c` reused verbatim (matching its `APP_MSG_WIFI_*` event contract), not the source's dual AP+STA `wifi_app.c`.
- **HTTP API (modernized to a JSON body):** `POST /api/v1/relay` with `{"state":"on"|"off"}` → `{"relay_status":"ON"|"OFF"}`; `GET /api/v1/relay` returns the same. Parsed with the IDF-bundled **cJSON** (`REQUIRES json`, no new PlatformIO deps). This intentionally replaces the source's header-based `/relayControl.json` contract and drops the `manual_override`/`auto` concept (there's no auto controller left to hand back to).
- **GPIO map:** relay (pump) on `GPIO2` **active-low** (matches the legacy `esp-idf-iot/web-server` wiring — the physical relay IN is on `GPIO2`; polarity + pin in `include/pump_config.h`). `GPIO2` is a boot **strapping** pin and idles HIGH when the pump is OFF, so if a USB flash can't enter download mode, disconnect the relay IN during flashing (or rewire to a non-strapping pin like `GPIO23` and update `RELAY_GPIO`). RGB status LED via LEDC on `GPIO25/26/27` active-high (same wiring as `sensor-zone`). LED status: **BLUE** boot/connecting → **GREEN** connected + server up → **RED** WiFi disconnected → **MAGENTA** while the pump is ON (overrides the status color, restored when it stops).
- Commands: `cd pump-zone && cp include/secrets.example.h include/secrets.h` (fill creds) → `pio run` / `pio run -t upload` / `pio device monitor` (115200). Then `curl -X POST http://<ip>/api/v1/relay -d '{"state":"on"}'`. **Not yet compiled or hardware-verified** — the first `pio run` pulls the pioarduino platform + IDF 5.3.2 (slow, one-time). No native test env in v1.

Uses a **static IP `192.168.0.5`** (`USE_STATIC_IP` in `pump_config.h`) instead of a DHCP reservation — `.5` is in ap-server's reserved `.2`–`.99` range, outside its `.100`–`.109` dynamic pool, so no reservation entry is needed (just don't reserve `.5` elsewhere). **The web-server code is deliberately left unchanged** (its default pump target stays `http://192.168.0.4`); this node is selected at runtime via the dashboard **Settings → Pump Control Settings → Pump URL = `http://192.168.0.5`**, which persists in browser localStorage and overrides the code default (no web-server rebuild). `DEVICE_ID = "pump_zone_01"` is cosmetic here (the hub reaches the pump by IP, mirrors its state under `main-pump`). `pump-zone/` (ESP32/ESP-IDF) is left untouched as the reference/fallback.
- **Why a rewrite, not a port:** `pump-zone` is `framework = espidf`, and **ESP-IDF has no ESP8266 target** — none of its foundation (`esp_http_server`, `driver/ledc`, cJSON, FreeRTOS-task model, pioarduino IDF platform) exists on the ESP8266. So it's rebuilt on **Arduino/ESP8266**: `ESP8266WebServer` (was `esp_http_server`), **ArduinoJson** (was cJSON), `WiFi.setAutoReconnect(true)` (replaces the hand-rolled `esp_timer` reconnect), and classic `setup()`/`loop()` (replaces the `main_task` + queue). The **HTTP contract is deliberately identical** so the two are interchangeable in the field.
- **HTTP API:** same as pump-zone — `POST /api/v1/relay` `{"state":"on"|"off"}` and `GET /api/v1/relay`, replying `{"relay_status":"ON"|"OFF"}` — plus two ESP-01-specific fields: `remaining_ms` (time until the safety cutoff while running) and `safety_off:true` when the last OFF was the dead-man timer rather than a command. No auth (WPA2 is the gate).
- **Safety cutoff (new, on by default):** the pump auto-shuts OFF `PUMP_MAX_RUN_MS` (default **5 min**) after the last `{"state":"on"}`; each `on` re-arms the countdown, so a long run is the hub re-POSTing `on` as a heartbeat. A silent/crashed hub can never exceed one window. `0` disables. This is the ESP-01's local protection — pump-zone had no such feature (it dropped the source's auto-irrigation entirely).
- **GPIO reality (ESP-01/01S):** only GPIO0 + GPIO2 are usable and **both are boot straps that must idle HIGH**; TX/RX carry the serial console — total budget is **one relay + one LED**. Relay (pump) on **GPIO0**, `RELAY_ACTIVE_LEVEL` **default active-high** (most ESP-01S relay boards); GPIO0 is also the flash-mode strap, so `relay_init()` forces the pump OFF first (a brief boot-time click is possible and expected). Status on the onboard LED (**GPIO2, active-low**) via blink codes: **fast blink** connecting → **solid** ready → **slow blip** WiFi lost → **double-blink heartbeat** pump running (overrides).
- **OTA (new):** `ArduinoOTA` enabled (hostname = `DEVICE_ID`, password = `OTA_PASSWORD` from `secrets.h`); it force-stops the pump before flashing. Added because wired reflashing an ESP-01 is painful — no USB/auto-reset, and GPIO0 (the relay pin) must be pulled LOW for download mode, so the first flash needs a USB-serial jig with the board off the relay; OTA handles everything after.
- Commands: `cd pump-zone-esp01 && cp include/secrets.example.h include/secrets.h` (fill creds) → `pio run` / `pio run -t upload` (wired, first time) / `pio device monitor` (115200). Then `curl -X POST http://<ip>/api/v1/relay -d '{"state":"on"}'`. **Not yet compiled or hardware-verified** — first `pio run` pulls the espressif8266 platform + ArduinoJson. **Bench-test relay polarity** before deploying (flip `RELAY_ACTIVE_LEVEL` if your board is active-low), and use a supply with headroom (relay coil + WiFi bursts can brown out a weak 3.3 V rail).
